## üîß Setup & Configuration

### Environment Variables
```env
TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
GUILD_ID=your_server_id
WELCOME_CHANNEL_ID=welcome_channel_id
CALENDLY_LINK=your_calendly_booking_link
LAUNCHPAD_ROLE_ID=premium_subscription_role_id
MEMBER_ROLE_ID=free_subscription_role_id
LOGS_CHANNEL_ID=logging_channel_id
```

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Configure environment variables in `.env` file
4. Run the bot: `python main.py`

### Initial Setup
1. Invite bot to server with Administrator permissions
2. Run `/setup_permissions` to configure channel access
3. Run `/setup_verification` in your welcome channel
4. Configure logging with `/setup_logs #logs-channel`

## üîÑ Verification Flow

### For New Members
1. **Join Server**: Member joins with subscription roles from Whop
2. **Role Removal**: Bot automatically removes subscription roles
3. **Monitoring**: User added to monitoring system to prevent role re-addition
4. **Verification**: User clicks verification button to create ticket
5. **Booking**: User books onboarding call via Calendly
6. **Confirmation**: User confirms booking in ticket
7. **Restoration**: Bot restores original subscription roles
8. **Completion**: User gains full server access

### Protection System
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Bot watches for unauthorized role additions
- **Instant Removal**: Automatically removes roles re-added by external systems
- **Verification Tracking**: Maintains verification state until completion
- **Logging**: Records all interference attempts for audit purposes

## üìä Monitoring & Logging

### Event Logging
- Member joins with subscription roles
- Role removals and restorations
- Verification starts and completions
- External bot interference detection
- Manual admin actions

### Status Tracking
- Users awaiting verification
- Users currently being verified
- Users being monitored for role protection
- System health and performance metrics

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Role Protection
- **Anti-Bypass**: Prevents users from gaining access without verification
- **External Bot Protection**: Blocks interference from Whop and other bots
- **Race Condition Prevention**: Handles concurrent operations safely
- **Data Integrity**: Maintains consistent user state

### Access Control
- **Admin-Only Commands**: Sensitive operations restricted to administrators
- **Permission Validation**: Verifies bot permissions before operations
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of permission errors

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Bot Missing Permissions**: Ensure Administrator role is assigned
- **Roles Not Restoring**: Check role hierarchy and bot position
- **Monitoring Not Working**: Verify environment variables are correct
- **Commands Not Appearing**: Run bot restart to sync slash commands

### Debug Tools
- Use `/debug_roles <user>` to check user role status
- Use `/check_stored_roles` to view system state
- Check console logs for detailed debugging information
- Use `/cleanup_tracking` to resolve data inconsistencies

## üìà Performance

### Optimizations
- **Efficient Role Lookups**: Fast set-based role checking
